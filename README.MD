//Final_Project
This project's aim is to create a generative art piece representing
climate change and it's effects on everyday life. I've done this through
creating a day/night cycle with an ever-changing landscape and atmosphere, showing the damage
we do daily to our environment.

Adjusting mouse position on the canvas increases the damage done to the environment.
Moving mouse position along along x axis, generates new landscapes.
