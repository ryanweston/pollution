# Pollution

ðŸŽ“ My first Javascript project written with the P5.js library. 

ðŸŒ² The project was developed as part of a generative art module during my first year of university. It aims to represent the effects of technology on the environment through a degredation of colour as well the generation of random text acting as greenhouses gases, that turn the environment dull over time. The user's mouse position input along the x-axis of the canvas, will "speed up" the time in the environment.
